## Features

- **User Registration and Login:** Allow users to register with their credentials and securely log in.
- **Password Hashing:** Utilizes the bcrypt library to securely hash and store user passwords.
- **JWT (JSON Web Token) Authentication:** Implements JSON Web Tokens for secure user authentication and authorization.
- **MongoDB Integration:** Stores user information in a MongoDB database using the Mongoose ODM (Object Data Modeling).
- **Validation with Joi:** Ensures data integrity by validating and sanitizing user inputs with the Hapi Joi library.
- **Express Middleware:** Uses Express.js middleware, including Morgan for logging and Body-parser for parsing incoming requests.
- **Redis Caching:** Enhances performance by integrating Redis caching for frequently accessed data.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/node-js-authentication.git
   ```

2. Install dependencies

```
npm install
```

 3. Set up Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file at the root of your project and configure the necessary environment variables. Here's an example of the required variables:

```plaintext
# .env

# Your MongoDB connection string
MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_uri

# Your JWT secret key for token generation and validation
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret

# Your Redis server connection information (if applicable)
REDIS_HOST=your_redis_host
REDIS_PORT=your_redis_port

# Other environment variables...
```

4. Start the Application

```bash
node app.js
```

### Usage

Follow the API documentation to integrate authentication features into your web application. The project includes a set of well-documented API endpoints for user registration, login, and other authentication-related actions.
